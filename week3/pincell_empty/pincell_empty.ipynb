    "# Create a Pincell\n",
    "Your task is to use the elements of OpenMC that we've covered in the last 2 weeks and create a simple pincell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The specifications of the pincell are as follows:\n",
    "- The pincell will be infinite in the z direction, and a box in the xy direction\n",
    "- Center the pincell at (0,0) in the xy plane\n",
    "- Inside the box will be a fuel cylinder nested inside a thin gap cylinder which is nested within a cladding cylinder\n",
    "    - The radius of the fuel cylinder will be 0.39 cm\n",
    "    - The outer radius of the gap cylinder will be 0.4 cm\n",
    "    - The outer radius of the clad cylinder will be 0.46 cm\n",
    "    - The box will have side lengths of 1.26\n",
    "- The boundaries of the box will be set to reflect neutrons\n",
    "- run with the following settings\n",
    "    - a point source at (0,0,0)\n",
    "    - 1000 particles per cycle\n",
    "    - 100 active cycles\n",
    "    - 20 inactive cycles\n",
    "- The following materials will be used\n",
    "    - Water (the moderator) with only H1 and O16 at 1 g/cm^3 density and 293 K\n",
    "    - Pure elemental Zirconium (the clad) at 6.6 g/cm^3 density and 293 K\n",
    "    - UO2 (the fuel) with 2 atoms Oxygen, to 1 atom Uranium with the Uranium being 3% U235 and 97% U238 all at 10 g/cm^3 and 293 K\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generally:\n",
    "- Do not use the code in the pincell_completed.ipynb to help complete this\n",
    "- Do not use AI to create the model for you (at least while you’re learning how it works (ie. this entire crash course))\n",
    "- Do use week2_workbook.ipynb and week3_workbook.ipynb for code help\n",
    "- Do refer to OpenMC documentation for additional help. Specifically the [users guide](https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/usersguide/index.html), it’s very well done"
