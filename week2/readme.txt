Pincells:
If you want some more practice, you might enjoy playing around with the pincell models. Both files are about identical, 
just one is a .py file and the other is a .ipynb file.

if you are in your openmc environment, you should be able to run the .py file and get the results out.
just type:

python pincell.py

The jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) is made for a more interactive experiance with the code and can be helpful for learning the syntax, etc.
