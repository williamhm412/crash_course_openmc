workbook:

This is the main learning tool for this week.

The workbook is designed to demonstrate the critical skills for this week and then stage challanges for the user to apply those skills.
We will walk through the workbook as a group.
The challenges will be done time-permitting.

Pincells:
If you want some more practice, you might enjoy playing around with the pincell models. Both files are about identical, 
just one is a .py file and the other is a .ipynb file.

if you are in your openmc environment, you should be able to run the .py file and get the results out.
just type:

python pincell.py

The jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) is made for a more interactive experiance with the code and can be helpful for learning the syntax, etc.
